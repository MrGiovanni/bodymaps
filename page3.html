                                    The task is to develop a model that can predict high-quality segmentations for

                                    organs. The training data consists of several thousands of examples on which models
                                    can
                                    be trained and validated.

                                    order to
                                    construct their models, however, that data must be publicly available as of
                                    1/16/2024.
                                    The same applies to pre-trained weights -- they must have been publicly available
                                    before
                                    the ImageNetCT-9K dataset was released on 1/16. This is to prevent unfair advantages
                                    for
                                    teams that may have amassed large private datasets. All external data use must be
                                    described in detail in each team's accompanying paper (described in the following
                                    section).

                                    Based on the performance we achieved by directly training the model on ImageNetCT-9K
                                    and
                                    evaluated on TotalSegmentor (without post-processing), your modelâ€™s performance
                                    should
                                    be higher than the results in the following table:
                                </p>

                                <p>All teams can directly submit the segmentation results on the challenge page to get
                                    the
                                    segmentation accuracy metrics.
                                    Please compress your results by running "zip XXX.zip ./*.nii.gz" and upload the zip
                                    file.

                                    The submission should include: (Email subject: YourTeamName-TeamLeaderName-Testing

                                <p>(1) a download link to your Docker container (teamname.tar.gz); If the Docker
                                    container
                                    does not work, we will return back the error information to the participants.
                                    Participants with technical failure are allowed to resubmit their algorithms with
                                    one
                                    extra time. When the evaluation is finished, we will return back the evaluation
                                    metrics
                                    via email. All valid submission results will be reported on the leaderboard.</p>

                                <p>(2) a sanity test video record (download example: Google drive, Baidu Netdisk) Please
                                    test your docker on validation case: XXX.nii.gz, XXX.nii.gz, XXX.nii.gz and record
                                    the
                                    prediction process. For each case, the running time should be within 60s.

                                <p>(3) a methodology paper (template) Please carefully read the template and the common
                                    issue before writing the manuscript. The evaluation process mainly focuses on the
                                    paper's completeness. Don't worry about the low wDSC/wNSD. Since this segmentation
                                    task
                                    is very challenging, all attempts are worth sharing with readers. We will not reject
                                    papers because of low wDSC/wNSD.
                                </p>

                                    The submitted Docker container will be evaluated with the following commands. If the
                                    Docker container does not work or the paper does not include all the necessary
                                    information to reproduce the method, we will return back the error information and
                                    review comments to participants.
