                    <p>Variations in organ sizes and shapes can indicate a range of medical conditions, from benign anomalies to life-threatening diseases. Precise organ volume measurement is fundamental for effective patient care, but manual organ contouring is extremely time-consuming and exhibits considerable variability among expert radiologists. Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the promise of improving volume measurement accuracy and reducing manual contouring efforts. We formulate our challenge as a semantic segmentation task, which automatically identifies and delineates the boundary of various anatomical structures essential for numerous downstream applications such as disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Our primary goal is to promote the development of advanced AI algorithms and to benchmark the state of the art in this field..</p>

                    <br>
  
                    <p>The BodyMaps challenge particularly focuses on assessing and improving the generalizability and efficiency of AI algorithms in medical segmentation across diverse clinical settings and patient demographics. In light of this, the innovation of our BodyMaps challenge includes the use of (1) large-scale, diverse datasets for training and evaluating AI algorithms, (2) novel evaluation metrics that emphasize the accuracy of hard-to-segment anatomical structures, and (3) penalties for algorithms with extended inference times. Specifically, this challenge involves two unique datasets. First, AbdomenAtlas, the largest annotated dataset [Qu et al., 2023, Li et al., 2023], contains a total of 10,142 three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) volumes. In each CT volume, 25 anatomical structures are annotated by voxel. AbdomenAtlas is a multi-domain dataset of pre, portal, arterial, and delayed phase CT volumes collected from 88 global hospitals in 9 countries, diversified in age, pathological conditions, body parts, and race background. The AbdomenAtlas dataset will be released by stages to the public for AI development, where in each stage we will release 1,000 annotated CT volumes. Second, JHH-1K [Park et al., 2020] is a proprietary collection of 1,150 dual-phase CT volumes from Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), where 22 anatomical structures are annotated by voxel. CT volumes and annotations of JHH-1K will not be disclosed to the public and are exclusively reserved for external validation of AI algorithms. The final scoring will not only be limited to the average segmentation performance but also prioritize the performance of hard-to-segment structures and consider the inference speed of the algorithm. We hope our BodyMaps challenge can set the stage for larger-scale clinical trials and offer exceptional opportunities to practitioners in the medical imaging community.</p>

Note that you can use external datasets to train your model for better performance. Second, the validation dataset, TotalSegmentor, is a public dataset that is used in an instant and continuously opened submission-and-validation leaderboard to evaluate your model repetitively. Last, the private testing dataset, JHH-1K, reflects a real-world, diverse patient population that encompasses a broad spectrum of pathological conditions, age groups, and demographic backgrounds.

                                The task is to develop a model that can predict high-quality segmentations for abdominal organs. The training data consists of several thousands of examples on which models can be trained and validated.

            Teams are allowed to use other data in addition to the official training set in order to construct their models, however, that data must be publicly available as of 1/16/2024. The same applies to pre-trained weights -- they must have been publicly available before the ImageNetCT-9K dataset was released on 1/16. This is to prevent unfair advantages for teams that may have amassed large private datasets. All external data use must be described in detail in each team's accompanying paper (described in the following section).

            <p>
            Based on the performance we achieved by directly training the model on ImageNetCT-9K and evaluated on TotalSegmentor (without post-processing), your modelâ€™s performance should be higher than the results in the following table:

                        <h4><b>Evaluation Metrics</b></h4>

                        <p>The segmentation accuracy metric:</p>
    
                        <p>Weighted Dice Similarity Coefficient (wDSC). This metric evaluates the overlap between algorithm output and ground truth, with a weighting factor that reflects the segmentation difficulty for each structure. The weight for each structureâ€™s DSC is estimated based on the per-class segmentation performance reported in existing literature (e.g., [Liu et al., ICCV 2023]). Some structures are inherently more difficult to segment than others due to blurry boundaries, small in size, and tubular structures. Our weighted metric is novel compared to the common practice in segmentation challenges, where only the average DSC is calculated uniformly across all classes.</p>
                        
                    <p>Weighted Normalized Surface Distance (wNSD): The wNSD emphasizes the accuracy of the boundary delineation between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth. This is particularly important for precise organ volume measurement and subsequent surgical planning.</p>
                        
                <p>The segmentation efficiency metric:</p>
                        
            <p>Running Time: A maximum inference time of 60 seconds is allowed for each case. Note that we ignore the docker starting time for an accurate measurement. Cases exceeding this limit will be deemed failures, with their DSC and NSD scores set to zero.</p>

        <p>Area Under GPU Memory-Time Curve (MB) [Ma et al. FLARE 2023]: The algorithm's memory efficiency is measured over time, considering the computational resources it uses, as reflected in the GPU memory-time curve. We offer a tolerance of 16GB for GPU memory consumption, which aligns with the affordability and availability of such GPUs in most medical centers.</p>

This ensures that the challenge reflects a real-world, diverse patient population. Detailed statistics can be found in the corresponding publications.</p>
                        <p>For ImageNetCT-9K, we will provide 296K masks and 3.7M annotated images that are taken from 68 hospitals worldwide, spanning four distinct phases: pre, portal, arterial, and delayed.</p>
                        <p>For JHH-1K, a total of 1,150 dual-phase contrast-enhanced CT volumes from 575 subjects were acquired from 2005 to 2009. There were 229 men and 346 women (mean age: 45 Â± 12 years; range: 18â€”79 years).</p>
